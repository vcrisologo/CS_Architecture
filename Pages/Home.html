			<p id="definition">Architecture is derived from the Latin word "architectura" or the Greek word "Arkhitekton" in which <i>Arkhi</i> means "chief" 
			and <i>tekton</i> means "builder". In definition, it is the art and science of designing buildings 
			and other physical structures. A wider definition often includes the design of the total built environment 
			from the macro level of town planning, urban design, and landscape architecture to the micro level of construction,
			details and, sometimes, furniture (All About Architechture, 2018).

			<h1 id="HoA">History of Architecture</h1>
			
			<p>Looking back in the Neolith period, around the 10,000 B.C., this is when Architecture most likely originated. At this time, people 
			stopped living in caves and  decided to build proper shelters and new structures. One of the historical structures that still stand today is the <b>Stonehenge</b>:</br>

			We also have the <b>Great Wall of China</b>. Although it is now illegal to go inside of it, it still remains until today: </br></br>

			There are honestly more of these structures around the world and they are a proof of the improvement/development of Architecture over time. But aside from it's History,
			another interesting thing about Architecture is that it has multiple types. And this will be tackled in the following part of the page.
			</p>
			</br>
			<hr>
			<h1 id="ToA">Types of Architecture</h1>
			<p>There are many types of Architecture that existed in the past such as Gothic, Baroque, Victorian Architecture, etc. 
			<i><b>Gothic Architecture</b></i>, just like the  Barouque Architechture, is a type of European Architecture. This one lasted for almost 4 centuries, starting from the mid-12th century 
			to the 16th century. This type of architecture mainly focuses on masonry buildings and is characterized by cavern-like interior designs. 
			
			</br>
			</br>
			
			<i><b>Baroque Architecture</b></i> on 
			the other hand, is another type that originated in Italy around the 17th century. It got popular enough to spread althroughout Europe and even in Western areas such as the US. 
			This type of architecture was one of the most creative types I believe. With its design being full of art like drawings or paintings (specially on the ceiling), it's no wonder 
			that it got widespread in Europe.
			
			</br></br>
			We also have the <i><b>Victorian Architecture</b></i> which is a type of Architecture that was developed during Queen Victoria's reign. This type appealed to the Romantic idea
			during the victorian period that in designing things and structures, they should prioritize beauty rather than practicality.
			</br></br>
			Now while we have historical Architecture, we also have new types of Architecture in our present day. For instance, are Minimalist and Maximalist Architecture. <i><b>Mainimalist Architecture</b></i>, 
			from the word minimalist, the aim of this type is to design as minimal and simple as possible. Meanwhile, <i><b>Maximalist Architecture</b></i> is the total opposite. In this type, the aim is to be 
			as maximal as possible, designing structures in a way that shows or describes "abundance".
			</br>
			<hr>
			<h1>Summary</h1>
			In summary, Architecture is continuously developing and evolving from time to time. The mentioned types above are only a small portion of the actual number of types of Architecture.
